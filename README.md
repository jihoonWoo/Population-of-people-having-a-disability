# Population-of-people-having-a-disability

This repository facilitates the process of generating insight from Australia health and disability data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “17% of Australians reported having a disability in 2015 ”. 

The Australia health and disability data was collected from ABS-Health-and-Disability-2015(10.5281/zenodo.4939862)  Zenodo repository that contains  information about the population, health and disability in Australia. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
